   abstract = {The monitoring of forested ecosystems relies on an accurate description of forest structure. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), launched in September 2018, carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument capable of detecting individual photons reflected back from vegetation canopy. ICESat-2 data is delivering global estimates of forest structure; however, analysis of the performance of ICESat-2 on-orbit data across a range of forest conditions remains limited. This study derives structural estimates of (i) canopy height, (ii) canopy cover and (iii) canopy height variability from ICESat-2 data acquired in snow-free and low atmospheric scattering conditions over different boreal forest structural types in Ontario, Canada. ICESat-2 structural estimates were derived from the Global Geolocated Photon Data (ATL03) and Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data products and compared against single-photon detection airborne LiDAR (Leica SPL100). An extensive network of ground plots were used to stratify the study area into three distinct forest structural groups, each resulting from different stand development stages. ICESat-2 and SPL100 estimates of canopy height were compared at the ATL03 photon level, whereas estimates of height variability and canopy cover were compared for spatial analysis units (AU; mean size = 1287 m2). ICESat-2 photons returned from the top of the canopy underestimated canopy height relative to SPL100 by an average of 2.3 m overall and corresponded most strongly to the 90th percentile (P90) of coincident airborne SPL100 returns (root mean square difference (RMSD) = 2.9 m and correlation coefficient (r) = 0.84). The lowest average underestimation of SPL P90 was observed in homogeneous stands that were relatively simple, and single-layered with a single dominant species (RMSD = 2.5 m, r = 0.84). We observed the least agreement of ICESat-2 and SPL forest structural metrics in over-mature stands with complex structure and greater variability in canopy heights (RMSD = 3.5 m, r = 0.64). For the AUs, the strength of the relationship between SPL100 and ICESat-2 canopy height percentiles increased with increasing height percentiles (e.g. P25 RMSD% = 77.8%; P95 RMSD% = 23.7%). ICESat-2 generally underestimated canopy height variability relative to the SPL100 data, with both data having similar absolute variability (standard deviation of canopy heights RMSD% = 26.8%, r = 0.75), but lower agreement in relative variability (coefficient of variation of canopy heights RMSD% = 33.9%, r = 0.45). Herein we propose the use of the vegetation fill index as a method to estimate canopy cover with ICESat-2. Comparison of SPL100 and ICESat-2 vegetation fill indices at the AU level resulted in strong agreement overall (RMSD% = 19.7%; r = 0.57). These observations and results contribute to the overall objective of building a comprehensive understanding of the performance of ICESat-2 for characterizing vegetation structure in boreal forest environments.},

   abstract = {The uptake of technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and more recently digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) enable the characterization of 3-dimensional (3D) forest structure. These forest structural attributes are widely applied in the development of modern enhanced forest inventories. As an alternative to extensive ALS or DAP based forest inventories, regional forest attribute maps can be built from relationships between ALS or DAP and wall-to-wall satellite data products. To date, a number of different approaches exist, with varying code implementations using different programming environments and tailored to specific needs. With the motivation for open, simple and modern software, we present FOSTER (Forest Structure Extrapolation in R), a versatile and computationally efficient framework for modeling and imputation of 3D forest attributes. FOSTER derives spectral trends in remote sensing time series, implements a structurally guided sampling approach to sample these often spatially auto correlated datasets, to then allow a modelling approach (currently k-NN imputation) to extrapolate these 3D forest structure measures. The k-NN imputation approach that FOSTER implements has a number of benefits over conventional regression based approaches including lower bias and reduced over fitting. This paper provides an overview of the general framework followed by a demonstration of the performance and outputs of FOSTER. Two ALS-derived variables, the 95th percentile of first returns height (elev_p95) and canopy cover above mean height (cover), were imputed over a research forest in British Columbia, Canada with relative RMSE of 18.5% and 11.4% and relative bias of -0.6% and 1.4% respectively. The processing sequence developed within FOSTER represents an innovative and versatile framework that should be useful to researchers and managers alike looking to make forest management decisions over entire forest estates.},

   abstract = {Single-photon lidar (SPL100) is a recently commercialized airborne lidar system facilitating efficient wide-area acquisitions of high-density point clouds due to its capacity for higher altitude acquisitions compared to traditional linear-mode lidar (LML) systems. Increased acquisition efficiency and point densities make SPL100 attractive for forest management applications. SPL100 utilizes 532 nm (green wavelength) lasers, wherein there is reduced reflectance from vegetation, increased sensitivity to solar noise, and increased signal attenuation, which may impact the vertical distribution of SPL100 returns in forest canopies. We assessed SPL100 data acquisitions over managed forests in north-eastern Ontario, Canada, using high-density unmanned aerial vehicle-borne laser scanning (ULS) data as reference over a range of forest conditions with variable vertical structure. Signal attenuation depth of individual SPL100 returns was estimated through a surface model normalization approach stratified by a ULS-derived structural index that compared densities of returns in the upper canopy to low vegetation and near ground. Canopy signal attenuation was closely matched in both systems, particularly in the upper canopy and near the ground surface; however, results showed a 31% reduction in the relative characterization of mid-canopy vegetation layers by SPL100 under conditions identified by the structural index as closed canopy, compared to the ULS system.},

   abstract = {An increasing number of jurisdictions are integrating airborne laser scanning (ALS) into forest inventory programs to produce spatially explicit and accurate inventories of forest resources. However, wall-to-wall ALS coverage relative to the total area of managed forest remains limited in large forest nations such as Canada, wherein logistics, cost and acquisition capacity can be limiting factors. Technologies such as single photon light detection and ranging (SPL) have emerged commercially, which have the capacity to provide efficient ALS acquisitions over large areas and with a greater point density than conventional linear-mode ALS. However, the large-scale operational application of SPL in a forest inventory still needs to be effectively demonstrated. In this study, we used wall-to-wall SPL data (collected with a Leica SPL100) across a 630 000 ha boreal forest in Ontario, Canada to develop a forest inventory. Specifically, we used a structurally guided sampling approach enabled via a principal component analysis of the SPL100 data to establish a network of 250 ground plots. Random forest models were then used to produce area-based estimates of forest attributes of interest. Results demonstrated that the sampling approach enabled the optimization and enhancement of the existing plot network by extending the range of sampled structural types and reducing the number of plots in oversampled forest types. Moreover, Lorey’s height, basal area, quadratic mean diameter at breast height, stem density, gross and merchantable volume and above-ground biomass were estimated with a relative root mean square error of 8.5, 19.76, 13.97, 30.82, 21.53, 23.79 and 22.87 per cent, respectively, and relative bias &lt;1 per cent. Model accuracies achieved using the SPL100 were comparable with those obtained using linear-mode ALS in a previous forest inventory. This study demonstrates the utility of the SPL100 for the complete development of a forest inventory over large forest areas, from ground plot establishment through to the production of forest attribute estimates.},

   abstract = {Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data are increasingly used to inform sustainable forest management practices. Information about species composition is needed for a range of applications; however, commonly used area-based summaries of LiDAR data are limited to accurately differentiate tree species. The objective of this study was to map dominant species groups across a large (>580,000 ha) boreal forest by combining area-based and individual tree metrics derived from single photon LiDAR data with multispectral information derived from Sentinel-2 imagery. Classification of the forest into jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), mixed conifer, mixedwood, and hardwood species groups resulted in an overall accuracy of 67.8% compared with field data. A more generalized classification into softwood, hardwood, and mixedwood had an overall accuracy of 83.2%. The reflectance in the red edge region of the electromagnetic spectrum (λ = 740 nm), the area and volume of tree crowns, and the cumulative distribution of LiDAR returns in the canopy were particularly important variables to discriminate between species groups. Wall-to-wall predictions of species groups based on remotely sensed data—as derived herein—could provide a spatially-detailed alternative to stand-level species composition information traditionally derived from photo-interpreted aerial imagery.},

   abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be – due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates – insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.},
